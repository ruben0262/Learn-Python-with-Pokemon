    "- `with` statement guarantees cleanup — even if exceptions occur\n",
    "- Context managers implement `__enter__` and `__exit__`\n",
    "- `__enter__` runs at the start (setup)\n",
    "- `__exit__` runs at the end (cleanup) — always\n",
    "- `@contextmanager` decorator creates context managers from generators\n",
    "- `yield` in the middle — code before = setup, code after = cleanup\n",
    "- Multiple `with` statements: `with a, b:` or nest them\n",
    "- `__exit__` returning `True` suppresses exceptions\n",
    "- `contextlib.suppress(Exception)` — built-in exception suppressor\n",
    "- Common uses: files, locks, timers, database connections, temporary state"
